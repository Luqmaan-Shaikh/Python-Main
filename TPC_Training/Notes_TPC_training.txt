DAY 1 :
##
Lamma (Gen AI) - highest paid all over the world 

codility - wipro coding interview

Applications of Python :-
AI,ML
Game Dev
Web Dev 
Desktop S/W
DB
IOT

stack overflow survey 2024 - search
##

Features :-
python dynamically typed lang 
python does not have character datatype

y create data type 
-> to create temp value

MCQ :-
values in type cast / values not in type cast

list, string, dictionary - python interviews (logic building)

operations :- 
TPC_training_code -> code_d1_s1 #14, #15, #16 : -
identity op -> is , is not
membership op -> in , not in

SIR's Personal :- 
help4code eLearning - youtube 
help2AI.com - search 

TPC_training_code -> code_d1_s1 #18 : -
find -> will return only starting index 

TPC_training_code -> code_d1_s1 #20 : -
swapcase -> lower to upper and vice versa
title -> every word ka 1st letter
capitalize -> string ka 1st letter

for -> no of iterations is known
while -> no of iterations is not known

TPC_training_code -> code_d1_s2 #32 : -

zip -> multiple range functions



DAY 2 : 

##
# array -> fixed requiremnt (java)
# array_list -> dynamic (java)

# y c/cpp starts from MAIN_FUNCTION -> because it gets memory first 
##

Collection DT :

TPC_training_code -> code_d2_s1  : -

List -> order wise data , negative indexing , heterogeneous data , duplicate data are allowed , by nature it is growable , mutable 

how to repr stack/queue -> Using list we repr Stack and Queue

-> extend function 

-> insert function = that element goes to designated spot and element present on that goes ahead in the list by 1

-> .copy() -> Cloning 

-> Nested List 

mylist = [         0         1
 	0	[luqmaan , shaikh],
    	1	[77 ,          79],
    	2	[200 ,       yy ]
]


TPC_training_code -> code_d2_s1 #30 

-> Nested Loop : 

   0 1 2 
0  1 1 1
1  2 2 2
2  3 3 3 

(i,j) = 1,1
        1,2
        1,3
        2,1
        2,2
        2,3
        3,1
        3,2
        3,3

DAY 3 :

# ValueError: attempt to assign sequence of size 6 to extended slice of size 5

## 
Search --> George Hotz
##

## 

Tuple ->

1. Immutable
2. order wise data
3. repr by ()
4. duplicate data are allowed
5. by nature growable
6. Heterogeneous data are possible 


## diff btw list and tuple :

list -> when reqmnt is not fixed , go with list data type

type -> req is exactly fixed , which will not change in future 


Dictionary ->

1. dict repr {key:val}
2. unordered
3. mutable
4. growable
5. duplicates values allowed , duplicates keys not allowed

DAy 4 :

Function ->

1. Modular Programming


DAY 5 : 

Exception Handling ->

Error : 1. syntax error 2. Runtime error

syntax error solving -> programmer, tester , developer
error -- syntax, c/n be handled 

runtime error -> how? = behalf of developer
runtime error-- called as exception, can be handled

exception ->
1. predefined exception classes
2. user defined exception


syntax ==>

try :
	....
except xyz :
	....

Modules :

1. User defined
2. Predefined
